Detect circular references (up to now Thicket gets stuck in a cycle)


Test data must cover the following cases:
    a referent is final but located above a mountpoint
    a referent itself is a reference and located below a mountpoint
every case from the above shall, in turn, cover 2 subcases of referent location:
    1) inside 
    2) outside
the materialization scope


Maybe introduce thicket_ignore.txt files containing relative paths where Thicket
must stop diving deeper while analyzing the file tree.
That may improve performance and (more important) eliminate phony errors
caused by exotic filesystem artefacts like sockets, devices, etc.
